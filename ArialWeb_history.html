			Created by Patricia Saunders and Robin Nicholas in 1982, Arial has become one of the most wide spread typefaces in the world. It was included as one of the  four prepackaged fonts with Windows 3.1 and still is packaged with every Windows update ever since. Arial's noteriety comes from its practical uses by the general public. It is often seen in a myriad of business signs, street posters, and other simple print jobs. The use of Arial can be seen countless times throughout the city. It is often seen stretched and disfigured, however this has become a part of the allure of Arial. Although it is seen numerous times in print form, Arial's original intent was for the screen. It is able to hold up on lower resolution screens. Many neo-internet websites have used Arial because of its versatility.

TrueType formats of Andale Mono, Arial, Comic Sans Ms, Courier New, Georgia, Times New Roman, Trebuchet MS, Verdana, and Webdings.
